## 🔍 What is VGT Sentinel?

VGT Sentinel Community Edition is a **modular, zero-dependency WordPress security framework** engineered to neutralize deterministic attack vectors without sacrificing performance.

It is the open-source core of the VGT Sentinel suite — a battle-hardened, multi-layered defense system built on a **Zero-Trust architecture**. Every request is inspected, every header hardened, every upload analyzed, every file hashed.

```
Traditional WordPress Security:
→ Single plugin = single point of failure
→ Shared hosting overhead
→ No outbound control
→ No filesystem integrity monitoring

VGT Sentinel ZTNA Security Stack:
→ Stream-based WAF (AEGIS)             — SQLi, XSS, RCE, LFI neutralized
→ Kernel Hardening (TITAN)             — Server fingerprint masked
→ Stealth Engine (HADES)               — WordPress architecture obfuscated
→ Access Guard (CERBERUS)              — IP-validated brute-force prevention
→ Outbound Control (STYX LITE)         — Data exfiltration blocked
→ Payload Sanitizer (AIRLOCK)          — Binary upload inspection
→ Integrity Monitor (CHRONOS)          — SHA-256 filesystem diff-hashing
```

### 🕰️ 2.7 CHRONOS — System Integrity & Ghost Trap

Asynchronous filesystem integrity monitoring with honeypot tripwire.

```
Differential Hashing:
→ SHA-256 verified against integrity_matrix.php (PHP-formatted — prevents web exposure)
→ mtime + size pre-filter: hash only runs when metadata changes

Ghost Trap:
→ Honeypot file: wp-admin-backup-restore.php
→ HTTP access = immediate IP blacklisting

Execution Safety:
→ Async State Machine — max 20s Cron-Slice
→ No PHP timeout risk on large installations
```

---

## ⚙️ Performance Design

> **Zero performance tax. Maximum coverage.**

| Optimization | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Fast-Path Routing** | Static assets bypass WAF inspection entirely — saves >90% CPU cycles |
| **Stream Chunking** | Payload inspection via chunked reads — low, stable RAM footprint |
| **Async Scheduling** | CHRONOS runs in time-sliced cron — never blocks request handling |
| **Zero Dependencies** | No external libraries — no supply chain risk, no overhead |

---

## 🔌 Ecosystem Compatibility

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| **PHP** | 7.4+ (Recommended: 8.1+) |
| **Webserver** | Apache (auto), Nginx (manual rule injection), LiteSpeed |
| **Page Builders** | Bridge Manager auto-disables conflicting DOM/header interventions for Elementor, Divi, Oxygen |
| **VGT Ecosystem** | Native VisionLegalPro support via Shadow-Net Asset Routing |
| **VGT Myrmidon** | AEGIS Co-op Mode — whitelists Myrmidon ZTNA API endpoints automatically |
